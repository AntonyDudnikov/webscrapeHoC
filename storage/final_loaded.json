This underperformance is increasing unit labor costs and reducing competitiveness relative to the U.S. The labor market is softening, with unemployment rising and job openings decreasing, which may slow wage growth further. Long-term wage increases depend on productivity growth, which is hindered by low business investment and ineffective utilization of immigrant skills.
