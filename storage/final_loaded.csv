<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Patients in Canada are experiencing longer wait times for priority procedures like hip and knee replacements and cancer surgeries post-COVID-19, despite an increase in the number of surgeries performed. The Canadian Institute for Health Information reports a decline in the percentage of patients treated within recommended time frames since 2019. Disparities exist among provinces, with Ontario generally having shorter waits. Median wait times for certain cancer surgeries have also increased slightly. Strategies such as same-day discharges and hiring more physician assistants are suggested to improve efficiency.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Canada's federal government plans to reduce non-permanent resident arrivals, aiming to lower their population share to 5% from 6.5%. This policy may slow GDP growth by 0.5% by 2025 but won't significantly affect per-capita GDP, unemployment, inflation, or interest rates. An older population and lower labour force participation are expected, potentially easing housing demand but not solving long-term supply issues. The number of non-permanent residents needs to decline by 20% (500,000 people) over three years. Immigration helps mitigate population aging, with 70% of new permanent residents under 35, compared to 40% of Canadians.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Business sentiment and sales growth expectations have stabilized, with demand remaining weak but showing signs of optimism. Business conditions, sales outlooks, and employment intentions have ceased declining. Sales growth is anticipated due to population growth, market expansion, and expected interest rate declines. Investment plans are being moderated due to high costs and weak demand, with a focus on maintaining capacity. Job vacancies are easier to fill, and while wage growth is high, it is expected to slow. Pricing behavior is normalizing, but output price growth remains high due to slow wage growth moderation and cost pass-through.</p>

<p>Temporary foreign workers (TFWs) in Canadian primary agriculture have low transition rates to permanent residency (PR), with only 10% obtaining PR after five years and 16.8% after ten years. Transition rates are lower for lower-skilled occupations and those under the Seasonal Agricultural Worker Program (SAWP). Retention in agriculture post-PR is also low, with only around one-fifth remaining after five years. Over 60% move to other industries, and retention rates vary by skill level, program stream, and agricultural subsector. The study suggests that PR status for TFWs may not address the labor shortage in agriculture.</p>

<p>The study analyzed economic outcomes of government-assisted refugees (GARs) in Canada, comparing those who stayed in their designated cities to those who moved. GARs in smaller cities had higher employment and earnings than those in larger cities like Toronto. Movers to smaller cities also reported better outcomes. Differences in employment incidence (89%) and earnings (47%) between Toronto stayers and others were largely explained by the city's employment rate and GARs' source region.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) has become the predominant route for economic immigrants to Canada, with its share increasing from negligible in 2000 to 40% in 2023. The program has significantly influenced the distribution of immigrants across provinces, with a notable increase in the Prairie and Atlantic provinces. The PNP has also altered the demographics and occupations of immigrants, with a rise in those previously working as temporary foreign workers and in technical occupations. However, recent cohorts of provincial nominees have seen lower initial earnings compared to Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP) immigrants.</p>

<p>Canada's carbon pricing for heavy industrial emitters is deemed three times more effective than the consumer carbon price, according to the Canadian Climate Institute. Industrial pricing is projected to account for 20-48% of emission reductions from 2025 to 2030, while consumer pricing is expected to contribute 8-14%. To meet the 2030 goal of a 40% reduction from 2005 levels, Canada must address policy overlaps and increase stringency.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The global economy has slowed, with the US showing surprising strength due to a robust labour market. Euro area growth is minimal, while China's investment activity, especially in property, has weakened. Inflation is easing in the US and euro area, with improved supply conditions and a downward trend in core inflation. Canadian GDP growth exceeded expectations in Q4 2023, driven by exports, but domestic demand fell. Canadian CPI inflation eased to 2.9% in January, with goods prices slowing but services remaining stable. Shelter costs continue to drive inflation, with high mortgage interest costs contributing significantly.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
A new report suggests the cost to address selenium contamination from Teck Resources' Elk Valley coal mines could reach $6.4 billion, far above the $1.9 billion security bond held by the B.C. government. The estimate accounts for building and operating water treatment plants for 60 years. Wildsight, the report's publisher, fears taxpayers may bear the excess cost. Teck disputes the figures, claiming full compliance with provincial requirements. The issue has escalated to the International Joint Commission due to transboundary water concerns. Teck's recent sale of its coal operations adds to the uncertainty of addressing the pollution.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Household credit growth is at its lowest since the 1980s, with real growth barely above zero and consumer credit in negative territory. Insolvencies have risen by over 20%, but are mostly debt restructuring proposals rather than bankruptcies. Delinquency rates are up, but early-stage delinquencies are declining. Half of all mortgages, over one trillion dollars' worth, are yet to reprice, with an estimated average interest payment shock of 15% per year from 2024 to 2026. Renters show signs of stress with rising delinquency rates, holding 60% of non-mortgage debt and 85% of serious delinquencies.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
The U.S. Department of Agriculture's new voluntary labeling rules for ""Product of USA"" or ""Made in the USA"" are set to disrupt the integrated meat and livestock supply chains between Canada and the U.S. These labels will only apply to products from animals born, raised, slaughtered, and processed in the U.S. starting in 2026. Canadian officials express concern over potential trade disruptions and are reviewing the rule's compliance with international trade obligations. The Canadian meat industry, which has traded over $11.3 billion in exports to and imported nearly $4.9 billion from the U.S. since 2022, advocates for reduced trade barriers.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Mark Aylward, a nurse practitioner from Newfoundland and Labrador, participated in a pilot project aimed at reducing reliance on costly out-of-province travel nurses. The government spent $35.6 million on for-profit agency nurses in five months, a significant increase from the pre-pandemic $1 million annual average. The new program offers unionized nurses higher wages to work in rural areas, saving money compared to agency rates. Over 100 nurses have joined since September 2022, with the project extended to January 2025. Alberta has a similar program, paying an extra $25 per hour to fill staffing gaps.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
B.C. Premier David Eby has expressed concern over potential national security risks posed by cargo cranes in Canadian ports, following a U.S. investigation into Shanghai Zhenhua Heavy Industries Co. Ltd. (ZPMC). The U.S. found hidden modems in cranes that could be exploited by China. ZPMC cranes, which constitute about 80% of those in American ports, are under scrutiny. Canadian agencies have been contacted for comment, but no official probe has been confirmed. ZPMC denies cybersecurity risks, while Canadian companies using ZPMC cranes assert their own security measures.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Canadian EV sales grew from less than 1% in 2017 to 9.1% in Q4 2022, with higher rates in British Columbia (18%) and Quebec (14%). EV adoption could increase Canada's electricity load by 7.5% to 15.3%, requiring significant new generating capacity. Projections suggest the need for up to 13 new 500-MW gas plants or 10 new 1,000-MW hydroelectric facilities. Alternatively, nearly 5,000 wind turbines could be built, but would require backup from gas plants, hydropower, or batteries, potentially necessitating subsidies. Immediate development of infrastructure is crucial to meet EV demand.</p>

Thermal-electric power producers were the largest users, accounting for 83.7% of intake and 84.7% of discharge. Manufacturing followed with 14.8% of intake and 13.2% of discharge, while mining contributed to 1.5% and 2.1% respectively. The majority of water, 83.7%, was sourced from self-supplied surface water. Water recirculation decreased by 15.9% to 13.3 billion cubic metres. No significant changes in intake, recirculation, or discharge volumes were observed in manufacturing and thermal-electric power industries over the past decade, but mining has seen a gradual decrease since 2017.</p>
