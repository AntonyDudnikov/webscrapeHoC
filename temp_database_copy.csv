The US economy remains strong, driven by consumer spending, while growth in the euro area and China faces challenges. Inflation has declined due to lower energy prices and a weakening US dollar.

Inflation has eased slightly, but shelter price inflation remains a concern. The Bank of Canada has maintained the policy rate at 5%, noting that while monetary policy is cooling the economy and reducing inflation, further action may be needed to achieve price stability.

The labor market shows signs of easing but remains tight, with wage growth between 4-5%. Inflation has been volatile but is showing signs of easing, except for food and shelter costs. Core inflation remains persistent, leading to an upward revision of the near-term inflation outlook.

The Governing Council debated the adequacy of the current 5% policy rate to achieve the 2% inflation target.
