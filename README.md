# Central Database for Economic Reports and Statistics for Ad Hoc Retrieval
## Description
The primary purpose of this project is to facilitate swift and convenient accessibility of trusted information for both the policy and communication teams to increase efficiency of processes. The workflow starts by daily monitoring of the  pre-validated sources, in the event of any new releases, automated web scraping scripts would deploy retrieving the necessary data. It would be stored in a cloud database, enabling various users around the office simultaneous access. The user interface would be an application from Microsoft PowerApps. Additional output formats will be created as requirements evolve.

## Methods
Due to the limited financing available for this project, common industry used tools and services could not be used. This project was therefore pieced together using python's Selenium package for the webscrapping, google drive as the cloud based repository, ChatGPT API for the processing and Microsoft PowerApps as the user interface.
